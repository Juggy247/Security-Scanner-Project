# Project Idea
  Our project idea is to create a web-based security scanner application that checks whether a website is secure or not. The main goal of this application is to help users easily identify potential security risks in any website by simply entering its URL.

 - Web Framework: Flask
 - Web Scraping & HTTP: Requests, BeautifulSoup
 - Database: MongoDB with PyMongo
 - Domain & DNS Analysis: dnsPython, python-whois
 - Security & API Tools: Flask-Limiter, Flask-CORS, Flasgger
 
We use Python as the main programming language and Flask as the web framework for building the web-based security scanner.
